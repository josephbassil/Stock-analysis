# Election_Analysis

## Overview of project: Purpose of this analysis
Steve's parents want to know how actively DQ and different stocks were traded in 2017 and 2017 so they can make the right decision with their money based on a clear data set showing volumes traded and what stocks did well.

## Results:  
Looking at the the two tables, 2017 stock performance and 2018, our formatting shows us  clearly the major performance difference. Taking for example , "AY" did great in 2017 with 8.9% return, but plunged -7.3% in 2018.
Another example is the "DQ" stock where it skyrocketed almost 200% in 2017 (199,4%) then dropped -62,6% in 2018. 
The only stock that had bad performance returns during the two years was the "TERP".
On the other side, 2 stocks kept their return in the postive range "ENPH" and "RUN" which jumped from 5.5 % retun in 2017 to 84.0% in 2018 as opposed to the majority of our stocks
